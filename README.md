# Pytorch model definitions, training and testing for image retrieval

The code in this repository was mainly developed by Maxime Portaz
and Matthias Kohl during the Master's thesis of Matthias Kohl.

The repository is organized as follows:
- the **model** folder contains model definitions and custom PyTorch
modules needed for training
- the **train** folder contains training scripts and parameters
- the **test** folder contains testing scripts and parameters
- the **utils** folder contains many utilities for handling datasets,
strings, images, as well as generic training routines used here

## Testing and training a model for instance retrieval
1. Required packages: Python 2.7, NumPy, SciPy, OpenCV-Python
(Python bindings for OpenCV 3.2) and PyTorch 0.12
2. Edit and run *pre_process_dataset.py* to pre-process
images to be at the correct size (or correct size on the smaller
side and given maximal aspect ratio)
3. Edit and run *create_mean_std_file.py* to create the
file needed to normalize images by mean and standard deviation
4. Edit *utils/params.py* and add all global parameters
to the following dictionaries. All dictionaries have the dataset
ID as key. This is the first part of the file-name of the dataset
(excluding folder path) before an underscore
    * *mean_std_files*: key is dataset ID, value is the file-name
    of the file generated by *create_mean_std_file.py*
    * *match_label_functions*: a function to extract labels
    from the name of an image
    * *num_classes*: the number of classes/instances in the dataset
    * *image_sizes*: this is usually always (3, 224, 224)
5. For testing, run *python test/[training method]_test.py* and
follow the instructions for command-line parameters, which should be self
explanatory
6. For training, edit *train/[training method]_p.py*.
Most parameters should be self explanatory. Then, run
*python train/[training method].py* from the main directory
